The leave policy entitles employees to various types of leave, including annual leave for planned vacations or personal time off, sick leave for health-related issues, family and medical leave for qualifying reasons under applicable regulations, and bereavement leave for the death of a close family member. The allocation of leave entitlements is determined based on years of service or company policy. Employees are entitled to 15 days of annual leave per year, 10 days of sick leave per year, and 5 days of bereavement leave per occurrence. The policy outlines the procedure for submitting leave requests, reporting absences, and returning to work after leave. Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing employee leave is emphasized. This policy is subject to periodic review and may be amended to address changing laws or organizational needs.
